    Aloha, I'm Remyce!
    Unfortunately, I'm not sunning it up in Hawaii but I can dream right!?
    Speaking of dreams...once upon a time I worked in fashion retail. It was fun
    and I enjoyed visual merchandising but I felt that I needed to explore my
    creativity in a new way. I had studied Interactive Art & Design before, which
    was where my love for creative technology evolved. A few online coding
    courses later, I then decided to immerse myself in the world of web development
    at General Assembly. Which I found both challenging and rewarding to say the least.
    Now? Well...I enjoy combining art with code, being a life-long learner and   I'm a junior Front-End Web Developer and part-time Creative 
    Arts student based in London.
